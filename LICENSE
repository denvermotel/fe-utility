                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or requiring you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you
have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software,
or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
know their rights.

  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

SUMMARY OF KEY CONDITIONS:

  0. You may copy, distribute and modify the software as long as you
     track changes/dates in source files. Any modifications to or
     software including (via compiler) GPL-licensed code must also be
     made available under the GPL along with build instructions and
     installation instructions.

  1. You may distribute this software's binaries or source code ONLY
     under the terms of this license, and you must include a copy of
     the license with every copy of the software you distribute.

  2. If you modify this software, you must release the modified source
     code publicly under the same GPL v3 license.

  3. You may not distribute this software for commercial purposes or
     integrate it into proprietary products without releasing all
     source code modifications under GPL v3.

  4. A copy of the full GPL v3 license is available at:
     https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.txt

                 END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
